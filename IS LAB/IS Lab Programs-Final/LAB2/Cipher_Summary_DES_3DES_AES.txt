Summary of DES, 3DES, and AES Algorithms

1. DES (Data Encryption Standard)
   - Symmetric block cipher (64-bit block size).
   - Key size: 56 bits (effective).
   - Uses 16 rounds of Feistel structure.
   - Formula (simplified Feistel round):
       L_(i) = R_(i-1)
       R_(i) = L_(i-1) XOR F(R_(i-1), K_i)
   - Vulnerable to brute-force due to small key size.

2. 3DES (Triple DES)
   - Improvement over DES by applying DES three times.
   - Key size: 112 or 168 bits (depending on 2-key or 3-key version).
   - Process: Encrypt → Decrypt → Encrypt (EDE mode).
   - Formula:
       C = E_K3(D_K2(E_K1(P)))
   - More secure than DES but slower.

3. AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
   - Symmetric block cipher (128-bit block size).
   - Key sizes: 128, 192, or 256 bits.
   - Uses Substitution-Permutation Network (SPN) structure.
   - Number of rounds:
       - 10 rounds (128-bit key)
       - 12 rounds (192-bit key)
       - 14 rounds (256-bit key)
   - Formula (round structure simplified):
       State = SubBytes(State)
       State = ShiftRows(State)
       State = MixColumns(State)
       State = AddRoundKey(State, RoundKey)
   - Much stronger and faster than DES/3DES.
