Cipher Algorithms Summary

1. Additive (Caesar) Cipher
- Description: Shifts each plaintext letter by a fixed key value.
- Encryption: C = (P + b) mod 26
- Decryption: P = (C - b) mod 26

2. Multiplicative Cipher
- Description: Each letter is multiplied by a key 'a' that is coprime with 26.
- Encryption: C = (a * P) mod 26
- Decryption: P = (a^(-1) * C) mod 26  [a^(-1) is modular inverse of a mod 26]

3. Affine Cipher
- Description: Combines multiplicative and additive ciphers.
- Encryption: C = (a * P + b) mod 26
- Decryption: P = (a^(-1) * (C - b)) mod 26

4. Brute Force (Caesar / Affine)
- Description: Try all possible keys until meaningful plaintext is found.
- Formula: Repeated decryption with all possible keys.

5. Chosen Plaintext Attack
- Description: Attacker encrypts chosen plaintexts to deduce the key.
- Formula: Based on known plaintext–ciphertext relation.

6. Hill Cipher
- Description: A polygraphic substitution cipher using matrix multiplication.
- Encryption: C = K * P mod 26
- Decryption: P = K^(-1) * C mod 26

7. Playfair Cipher
- Description: Digraph substitution cipher using a 5×5 key square.
- Rules:
  - Same row → replace with right letter
  - Same column → replace with below letter
  - Rectangle → replace with opposite corners

8. Vigenère Cipher
- Description: Polyalphabetic cipher using repeated keyword.
- Encryption: Ci = (Pi + Ki) mod 26
- Decryption: Pi = (Ci - Ki) mod 26

9. Autokey Cipher (Vigenère Variant)
- Description: Like Vigenère, but the key is extended with plaintext.
- Encryption: Ci = (Pi + Ki) mod 26
- Decryption: Pi = (Ci - Ki) mod 26, where key continues with plaintext itself.
